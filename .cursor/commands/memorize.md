# User Preferences

## Communication Style
- **Quick summaries** - Prefer concise summaries over lengthy explanations
- **Line items in chat** - Use bullet points and lists instead of full file contents
- **No full files in chat** - Don't paste entire files unless absolutely necessary
- **Git for code** - Use git commits and diffs for code changes, not chat

## Rationale
Full files make the app bulky unnecessarily. Git is the proper place for full file contents and version history.
